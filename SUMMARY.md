# Summary of EEG Data Analysis

This document summarizes the results of the EEG data analysis for face and non-face stimuli.

## ERP Results

The following plots show the event-related potentials (ERPs) for the face and non-face conditions.

## N170 Component Analysis

The N170 component, a negative-going ERP component that occurs around 170ms after stimulus onset, was analyzed for both conditions.

### Timing of N170 Component
The timing of the N170 component was compared between the face and non-face conditions.

### Amplitude of N170 Component
The amplitude of the N170 component was also compared between the two conditions.

## Statistical Analysis

A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the two sets of results. The p-values for both amplitude and timing were found to be less than 0.05, indicating a significant difference between the face and non-face conditions.

## Conclusion

The results of this analysis suggest that the brain processes face and non-face stimuli differently, as evidenced by the significant differences in the N170 component.
